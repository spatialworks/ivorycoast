Description: Designing surveys require relevant datasets to be used as basis for
    sample size calculations, sampling design, survey planning/logistics and
    survey implementation. These include datasets on population, lists of sampling
    clusters, map datasets for spatial sampling, and previous survey datasets that
    can be used for estimating indicator variance and design effects. This package
    contains relevant datasets for use in designing surveys in Ivory Coast.
